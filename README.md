# Looks good to me!

An Alfred workflow that selects a random emoji that's appropriate to be used
while reviewing a pull request. The set of emoji are ones I feel are positive or
neutral. It's entirely possible and very likely that some inappropriate emoji
were looked over. Please open an issue or a pull request if you encounter one!

## Why?

Random emoji are fun! :dash: :wedding: :information_desk_person:
